# Introduction

For a long time I wanted to understand, not only to know, how an
operating system works. But I was not able to find a path for reaching
that goal.

During the previous years I gained a lot of theoretical and
higher-level knowledge about how operating systems work. However, when
diving into a source code of a real operating system, it always seemed
to me like a different world. I also read some operating system
programming tutorials. It was a bit better but still far away from
what I was looking for. The information there was much more practical,
but it was explained as a final result of the author's learning. What
I needed the most was a story; a process of learning.

That's the reason why I decided to start writing this story.
